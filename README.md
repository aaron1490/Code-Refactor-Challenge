# Code-Refactor-Challenge

## Description - Code Refactor Challenge (Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge - Due on 05/12/2023)

### Refactor code on Horiseon Social Solution Services's website so that it meets web accessibility standards. 

- AS A marketing agency
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards.
- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

### We achieved this by

- Ensuring that semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- Made sure that HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contained accessible alt attributes
- Ensuring that heading attributes fall in sequential order (H1 through to H6)
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


## Usage

Below is a screenshot of how the website should function and display:
