# Code-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

Code Refactor Challenge (Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge - Due on 05/12/2023)

Refactor code on Horiseon Social Solution Services's website so that it meets web accessibility standards. 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
